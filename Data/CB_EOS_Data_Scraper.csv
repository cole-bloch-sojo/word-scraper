We had to fix the fire, clean up the line and go through 2 pallets of product to pick out the damaged cans and discard them. 2.) We had 2 separate events that accumulated over 40min of downtime where the carton infeed sensor was miss firing causing large quantities of boxes to fall into the machine causing jams prior to box opening up.  3.) 1.12 hours of downtime due to dekitting falling behind, we lost 2 people off the line although we started with 10, by mid shift we lost 2 people.

11/04/2024 12:00:00 AM,new item setup took the majority of the shift to dial in the machine. the film continued to bunch up and jam in the wrapping section which caused the film to pull back into the machine multiple times. Was unable to run consistently for any period of time which is likely caused by the thickness of the film (200 gauge) which is the max spec for the PP1 line.

Once the staff from BS1 completed their tasks with Waterloo, I replaced the less effective personnel from BP2 and sent the remaining staff home to improve the efficiency on BP2. 3. The discharge conveyor experienced backup, highlighting the necessity of having a dedicated pallet handler to prevent such occurrences. Additionally, the U conveyor also faced issues with boxes becoming stuck when the case sealer conveyor halted due to the discharge conveyor being full. This backup caused some cases to miss the required date codes, necessitating rework. 4. Quality issues emerged as some packages contained boxes glued together, leading to multiple mis-picks at the case erector.",BP2

12/02/2024 12:00:00 AM,"Today’s shift had multiple challenges that resulted in significant delays. The mechanics team spent 2 hours setting up the machine for the new recipe for the Poppi 12-pack, including adjusting the glue shots, which was more time-consuming than expected. The primary cause of downtime was the dekitting process, which took total of 1 hour and 24 minutes. The difficulty arose because one of the wraps needed to be removed manually, and one case contained 6*4 individual packs that required more time to dekitt than usual. Attempts to find a more efficient method by measuring and testing different techniques were unsuccessful, so the original process had to be reinstated. Additionally, there was a total of 19-minute downtime during the first run adjustments stops due to the glue pot. The glue used was from a different supplier and wasn’t the usual one, requiring temperature adjustments. Once the usual when we got to the daily used glue, temperature was adjusted and was back in operation . After resuming production, 2 pallets had to be reworked because the wrap quality was too loose and did not meet customer expectations. This required increasing the oven temperature, which further slowed down the process. Finally, there were 7 minutes of downtime due to machine adjustments when the glue didn’t shoot to the correct spots, causing trays to be half-closed. These issues led to falling short of the day’s production goal. IA for the run is IA71284",BS1

12/03/2024 12:00:00 AM,"BP2 line ran smoothly today with minimal stops. The main issue was a 17-minute downtime right after lunch caused by a broken part. The line stopped due to an overheating motor at the case sealer, which prevented the belt from starting. The mechanic inspected the motor and found a loose wire going into the panel, which caused the overheating. The motor's VFD settings were adjusted from P47 to P46, and the fan was turned on to help cool the motor faster. Meanwhile, the crew assisted with dekitting at BS1 during lunch. Once the mechanic confirmed the repair, the crew returned to BP2 to resume production. Another issue was with the Case Erector, causing total of 7 minutes of downtime throughout the shift.

12/10/2024 12:00:00 AM,"Today, BPP1 experienced several stops, mainly due to film jamming into the roller and flight bars being out of timing. A total of 1 hour and 25 minutes was spent addressing the film jam issue. The machine error indicated a film arm jam, but the film was not cutting. The mechanic initially adjusted the film, but it wasn’t successful. Upon further inspection, it was found that the film was not wrapped correctly according to the machine diagram. Once the film was adjusted properly, the issue was resolved, and the machine resumed operation. Afterward, the flight bars were found to be out of timing, resulting in 9 minutes of downtime. During this time, the crew was assigned to another work order on a different line. The mechanic worked on the flight chain issues, adjusting the height and resolving the timing problem. Once the adjustments were completed, the shift supervisor, mechanic, lead, and inventory team successfully completed the last 3 pallets for the work order. we were short of the Goal due to the scrap rate.

The manual line was started at 9:11 PM, which led to a delay in reaching the goal. Despite the late start, there were very few stops throughout the shift. The main downtime was caused by a WIP pallet change, totaling 2 minutes. Additionally, there was a 1-minute delay due to waiting for WIP/finished good pallets and some dekitting, which was addressed as quickly as possible to minimize further disruption.

12/11/2024 12:00:00 AM,"Today, BP1 had a generally smooth run with fewer stops. The main issue was a series of product drops by the robot, resulting in 24 minutes of downtime. The line lead was able to clear the jams each time. We also had 16 minutes of downtime due to a broken part repair, where the position sensor box (SV4) was misaligned. The mechanic adjusted it, and production resumed. Additionally, we experienced 12 minutes of downtime due to case jams and 6 minutes of downtime with the case erector starting at 20:41. The jams occurred at the case former and the tray table. Upon inspection, the mechanic found that the case dimensions were incorrect: the top flap had a larger cut, and the bottom flap was smaller. This caused a jam at the tray table, triggering the sensor issue. The team sorted through the faulty boxes and replaced the pallet. There were also 3 minutes of downtime when product fell onto the conveyor, caused by cardboard between two cans during dekitting. The line lead addressed this promptly. Both WO are fulfilled.

12/12/2024 12:00:00 AM,"BD1 had a generally good run today, despite a few unplanned stops. The main cause of downtime was can transfer jams, totaling 48 minutes for the shift. Additionally, having 4 Day 1 people on the line led to some gaps during the loading of cans into the machine. However, the line lead provided on-the-spot coaching and made adjustments throughout the shift to ensure a smoother transition. There was also an issue with one flap on the carton not getting glued properly, requiring the cans to be wiped and repacked. After mechanic inspection, the glue shot was adjusted, but the line still experienced back-and-forth stops due to can transfer jams. Another minor issue occurred with the cartons not opening from the magazine, which resulted in 3 minutes of downtime. The mechanic adjusted the height to resolve the problem.

12/12/2024 12:00:00 AM,"BP1 fell short of the production goal for the shift due to several unplanned stops. At the start of the shift, the boxes had just arrived, and there were 2 people short on HC. The main cause of downtime was 39 minutes due to the robot dropping products. This was caused by back pressure and occasional gaps due to cardboard debris, which the line lead cleared each time. There were also issues with the case erector, totaling 16 minutes of downtime throughout the shift. One instance involved a case jam caused by low pressure on the box. The mechanic adjusted the top portion of the machine to apply more pressure and resolve the issue. Additionally, there were 2 instances where the wrong pad needed to be changed, totaling 14 minutes of downtime. There was also 8 minutes of downtime for a broken part repair when the SV box clamp was out of position. This misalignment caused the robot to drop products because the boxes weren’t splitting at the tray table. The mechanic realigned and adjusted the position sensor, getting production back on track. Finally, 8 minutes of downtime were spent on a product jam, which the line lead cleared each time. With 1 hour and 21 minutes of unplanned stops, and the line was stopped due tp RM( Flavor Change) change with different BOM  the shift fell short of the production goal. IA for the shift IA72417",BP1
12/12/2024 12:00:00 AM,"BP2 had a productive run despite some unplanned stops. The main cause of downtime was an issue with the case erector, totaling 45 minutes of downtime for the shift. For one instance, the case erector failed to reset and wouldn’t start due to the flight chain falling out of timing. A mechanic inspected and adjusted the machine, bringing it back into production, and the line lead was able to clear any further case erector jams. Another key issue was with the robot palletizer, which mispicked and stopped, leading to 18 minutes of downtime. In one instance, boxes got caught in the gap between pallets. The mechanic placed a slip sheet to improve grip and support, resolving the issue and getting the robot back in operation. There was also a total of 4 minutes of downtime during dekitting. Lastly, 4 cases were scrapped due to leaking when they hit the pallet during placement. IA for the shift is IA72391",BP2

The inform tray former was not set up correctly, so the mechanic team had to adjust the box parameters. Following that, the timing of the case and cans coming together also required adjustment, resulting in a total downtime of 1 hour and 25 minutes. This caused a delay in production. In addition, there were 34 minutes of machine adjustments during the shift. One instance involved the glue shot not firing due to a misalignment, requiring the mechanic to make adjustments and restore production. There was also 11 minutes of downtime due to a tray former jam. The tray former was picking up two trays at once, jamming in the area.

Another issue occurred when the flight levels were out of timing, causing the boxes to crash into each other. To address this, the crew was sent for an early break, allowing the mechanic enough time to adjust the flight levels and get them back in proper alignment. After the break, we faced further case erector issues, this time with the kickout clutch release. The mechanic adjusted the clutch and released the tension on the chain to restore production.

Box jamming was experienced when the palletizer placed the first layer of boxes on the pallets. This issue primarily arose from the excessive gaps between the pallets, which resulted in multiple boxes falling off and becoming jammed in the gaps.  3. Waiting to conveyor to loaded- Raven was tagged as ""Waiting on cases"" 4. Some packs contained boxes that were bent due to the pallet strapping. 5. Flavor C/O",BP2

The suction cup wasn't grabbing carton properly had to replace both suction cups. Cans were getting stuck in the lanes due to speed being too slow. Maintenace sped up the belt which helped mitigate cans from getting stuck due to build up. Robotic palletizer had a loose fitting which wouldn't allow proper suction and would cause cases to fall.

01/22/2025 12:00:00 AM,"A couple persistent issues with BS1 tonight.  - Tray former picking arm consistently missed picks or multiple trays would push through. We examined the trays initially which did have a slight bend but not so much that it would've impacted picking. Tried multiple pallets of trays. Rob monitored throughout the night and made small adjustments to the tray magazine. Ultimately, an adjustment was needed to the magazine advancement setting as it was set for a slightly thicker tray, causing the conveyor to advance the cardboard more than what was needed. Post adjustment to this setting seemed to resolve the issue for the remainder of the shift. Issues and adjustments were communicated to the rest of the maintenance team for follow up in the morning.   - Film jams/wrap area faults more than normal. Rob and Jaqs lifted the wrapper conveyor and found a buildup of plastic around the cutter blade that needed to be cleared out. This resolved the film issues.   - Product fallen on conveyor turned out to be a lane being slightly too tight on the infeed causing cans to get pinched between lanes and fall over. Rob opened the lane slightly and we saw a big reduction of cans falling over on the infeed.",BS1

Personnel are now on a round robin rotation, when loaders far exceed the pace of dekit, 2 loaders rotate back to dekit until rollers are full and excess trays are withheld for a jam. Once rollers are full, the dekitters rotate back forward to loading. This maintains a consistent pace with the machine at 28cpm, without halting all of production when the tray former jams.  Tray former still proves to be problematic. Optimal setting for trays ~60hz, yields the highest consistency of trays, while minimizing the constant jams. Line performance heavily affected by jams.  To combat the tray formers' high user dependecy, individuals will be brought in an hour prior to shift, until four pallets of trays have been made. Then the HC will be needed only for the eight hour shift. Doing this will allow the line to continue operating while the jam is cleared.  Finished shift at 9600 physically, but one pallet was overbuilt at EOS yesterday 2/12, showing systematically only 9360. With all improvements and preparations in place, daily goal of 10,200 is within reach, and should be maintained as personnel begins to improve, and 4 pallets of trays are stocked.",Flight - PP1

Delayed start due to Tray former being down, Trays were coming out with no glue on one flap which caused down time on waiting on trays, Jaq and Jon took care of this issue. 2.Wrap area faulted: The operator changed the film and had it break while indexing it through the machine - Jose had to rethread the entire machine. This is because tape was used on the spliced in addition to the machine splice bar. The adhesive side of the tape wrapped around one of the rollers when indexing causing it to get stuck and the film splice stretched and ripped. 3.The PP2 HMI lost communication with the PLC, Jose had to restart the machine to get it back up. 4.Flavor changeovers-  Multiple work orders were completed, which resulted in downtime each time we switched flavors and cleared the line.

Issues began at 6:50 when PP1 had an issue with tension building up, cause unknown at the time. This caused the wrap to bunch up and fall out of the last four rollers. Restrung, and began running. Could not resolve issue, and spliced in a new roll. Temporary solution yielded about 45-1 hour of uptime.  As soon as poly pack came back up, the mandrel head for the tray former came apart. Did not witness it first hand, but machine went down and we began to use prebuilt trays to continue production while I remedied the problem. UHM/plastic material on sides of mandrel head prevented me from reattaching the screws that had shaken loose. Removed them and search for appropriate sized hex head bolts, ultimately fell one shy. More parts are required to entirely secure mandrel head to drive arm.  Once the tray former had been fixed, the poly pack went down once more. Same issue as before. Initially thought the sensors were preventing the roll of film from paying off correctly, and/or the roll of film was slipping on the rubber rollers. Ultimately discovered my observation from this morning was correct, and the wedge pin had fallen out of the motor, allowing it to slip, not pay off correctly, tripping the over travel alarm.  During adjustment of over travel and payoff sensors, heat tunnel lost power and wouldn't power on. Tech hard restarted machine and used multimeter to find no power despite all breakers being on. Unsure of what the resolution was, but power and functionality was restored around 1:27pm  One more issue after the wedge pin had been attached, maint. tech resolved timing issue. Unsure of what it was specifically, but was resolved in a matter of 3-4 minutes after 2:30.  Once production resumed, was able to run consistently to 2:50.

The existing e-stop on the machine was old and probably needed to be replaced anyways, but part of the issue is the placement of it, as associates tend to bump into it frequently which is the likely cause of the wires coming loose over time.

These issues were tagged as carton not opened in the Raven. Horizontal loader jam - 27 minutes lost. We saw jams on the horizontal loader due to cans bouncing back out after they were swept into the carton. Craig made an adjustment nose rail as the cans had too much room to move inside of the carton. Just before first break, we stopped the line due to the quality of the date coder. The date coder was cleaned which did not resolve the issue. Craig adjusted the viscosity setting on the date coder which corrected the issue. The date coder went down again at 9PM with the same issue as we saw earlier in the shift with no error code. Date coder was swapped out at end of shift.

Observation - deformed tetrapacks have a wider circumference causing jams - likely due to being the bottom pallet/layer double stacked pallets.   RC - When being pushed by the horizontal loader - tetrapacks have 1) jammed against the backplate collided with oncoming WIP on the infeed 3) rotated on the transfer plate while being pushed. 4) rotated due to the metal guards 5) collided with either the flights that support the cartons or the levers that close the minor flaps.   Mitigation - Coached team about monitoring back pressure. Set up visual guides for reference. Applied lucrative amounts on silicone spray on the transfer plate & guards to reduce friction. Utilized silicone tape on the guards to reduce friction. Dropped infeed conveyor speed from 21 to 20.

Initially the majority of the jams were after a film change. The jam was being caused by the film not being in sync with the flight bar. Adjustments were made by Randall.   -Machine adjustments: (Time lost 47 minutes) This was in response to the top tier going down multiple times (see engineer notes)  -DE kitting (time lost 16 minutes) The associates were moving a little slow at times. This is due to them being first day associates. I was able to coach them back into a good flow. I am confident that the same individuals will do better next time,TA1

A person needs to be by A2 at all times in case the wrap doesn't separate after the seal bar comes down. If there is no one there then wrap gets on the conveyor in the oven and will cause it to jam and stop. We also had an increase in can jams at the start of the day.

Reached out to Jose and suggested turning down the infeed conveyor speed because the cans were going in too fast. We lowered it down from 40 to 30 and this did help the issue, but it didn't go away entirely. So, we dropped it down to 25 and that seemed to get rid of the issue.

Alexis clarified that stickers should be applied before shrinking, resulting in the rework of five finished good pallets (the SOP has since been updated).  -In the film-wrapped area, the film impression was not being cut correctly while passing through the conveyor, necessitating sensor calibration. Additionally, there were multiple instances of film jams throughout the day.  -The slave axis repeatedly crashed on the trailing edges of cases as they passed through the pneumatic separator.  -Cases became jammed at the infeed conveyor, requiring the operator to clear the jams each time they occurred.  -The fly bar collided with cases.  -Flavor changeover.",BS1

04/24/2025 12:00:00 AM,"Downtime associated with BP2 can be attributed to several factors: - The absence of a second driver, as only one was available to operate the line, resulted in delays related to finished goods pallet changes, waiting for components, and WIP pallet changes. Although drivers from other lines assisted, they faced challenges as they were also required to manage their assigned lines.   Additionally, many personnel assigned to BP2 were inexperienced, which contributed to downtime as they required training to perform their tasks effectively; some struggled to maintain the necessary pace during the loading process.   Furthermore, the check weight machine experienced issues, leading to multiple box rejections despite being fully loaded. It appears that the physical position of the weigh conveyor had shifted significantly from its original location. Jose adjusted the weigh conveyor to ensure that cases traveled closer to the center of the load cell, as the discrepancies in weights and false rejections were caused by improper product positioning on the load cell.   Lastly, the robot palletizer was down for 4 hours and 37 minutes, necessitating manual palletizing, which further contributed to downtime as we awaited drivers to remove finished goods pallets from the positioners.",BP2

We resolved this by moving the other two flavors to the last belt, which resulted in a smoother run.  We also encountered issues with cans not standing upright due to belt vibrations and how the thickness of the box folds at the bottom. We resolved the issue by assigning two team members to push the cans back into place just before the loader loaded them into the cartons  12 minutes of machine adjustment: We had to make several machine adjustments throughout the run due to a high number of boxes failing to open properly.

The gap in the infeed conveyor requires constant attention, as dropping two cases in the gapped space will result in a feed fault and stop the machine.

Rob was able to make minor adjustments to the guides the reduce/resolve the issue - Crew struggled at times to keep the lanes full during pallet changes and dekitting the one WIP flavor that comes as 6x4 cartons  ---------------------------------------- - ID1 WO3629 - Start of shift saw a lot of flexing in the lanes due to the length of unsupported lanes in certain areas of the infeed. The flexing would cause cans in other lanes to back up until enough back pressure push them forward causing crashes as cans would at times have fallen on the conveyor by the time they reached the loading area. Rob was able to make adjustments to the lanes to reduce the amount of flexing. - Issues with can transfer jams, possibly due to the way the carton gets picked. Picker pulls the carton near the bottom as it is in the magazine and being a larger box, becomes top heavy as it pulls from the magazine and will sometimes break away from the suction cups on the picker arm causing faults and crashes.",BD1

05/12/2025 12:00:00 AM,"Carton not opened: Started having consistent jams at the loader, maintenance adjusted the speed of the conveyor since it seemed as if the back pressure was making the cans crash at the loading site. After adjusting the conveyor, maintenance also noticed that the cans at the loading site were being pushed up by the lane divider causing the cans to hit the case/ fall over resulting in a jam.  Maintenance doubled checked the sensor that triggers the lane divider to see if the sensor was working properly.  Maintenace found a faulty sensor that was staying activated (proximity stop sensor) at the back stop. Maintenace replaced the faulty sensor and adjusted the back stop/ got the loader closer to the cans since it seemed to be off the cans to much. Maintenance also adjusted the back stop since it would make the cans bounce/ tip over at the loading site. Maintenance also adjusted the height of top rail since it was allowing the cases to not be squared with a bulge on top of the case which would cause the loader to crash. Minor flap also wasn't being opened all the way which would result in jams, maintenance added silicone spray to the minor flap opener since it was getting stuck/ felt sticky.

After adjusting the flights, we noticed that as the cases advanced, they consistently shifted to the right. Maintenance made adjustments to the overhead, which helped but did not fully resolve the issue. As the cases moved up the ramp before the flaps closed, they shifted aggressively, contributing to the problem. Once that was corrected, the glue shot became misaligned. Maintenance believed this was due to the cases becoming slightly smaller after the product was packed inside. Additionally, we ran into print alignment issues. Despite the cases being squared, the print remained out of spec. We tested three pallets and attempted adjustments to the cylinder block but were unable to achieve consistent results.

Both spacer inside the lane fall off after reinstalling them Tetra packs continued to get stuck at the transfer and had to be hand pushed. Went from 87% uptime during the first two- and half-hour to 70% Uptime after break due to these issues.  TD2 Line wasn't ready till 6pm during that downtime had the team work on Anejo Downstack.

05/24/2025 12:00:00 AM,"We had several issues today that impacted our overall production.  1: We started the shift with 5 employees. I was able to partner with CSI and 1st shift to get 2 employees from 1st shift to stay until 2 more employees were sent to backfill them. Talked to Victor from CSI and they said they will consume the OT hours due to some employees needing to stay to cover 2nd shift. 2: We had several components on the Climax being held together by zipties. The first issue was the major flipper that closed the flap of the boxes was sliding down, causing 110 boxes to kick out or jam the line . I was able to connect with Mario via teams call to fix the flipper placement. The second issue was a bolt on the top rail came apart causing the rail to crush down on the boxes(this was also held up by zip ties but was not providing enough support). I connected with Mario to establish a new position to bolt the pin to in order to keep the bar held up. This was a major fix. 3: After last break, 1 box of PK's was not perforated enough, causing the flaps on both sides of the boxes to not close. This was escalated to Mani and the team and a Zendesk will be submitted to escalate to Refresco. 4: After last break 1 employee left bringing down our total employees down to 6 making it hard to fix jams.  Overall we had several situations that lead to roughly 1.5 hours of downtown throughout the shift causing us to miss goal by 108 CS.",Flight - C2(W)

To maintain a consistent production rate, we rotated loaders to ensure the line remained steady. There were a few minor maintenance issues before the first break, but nothing major, and production continued without significant interruption.   She needs to focus on performing Quality Control checks every 20 minutes. The goal is to take practical observations of how the line is operating, rather than aiming for perfect pictures each time. Increased teamwork and collaboration are essential for her to improve efficiency.

Maintenace got the machine running towards the end of shift once he found that the loader wasn't adjusted on correctly.   TD2: Majority of the issues were at the horizontal loader and with the cartons slipping out from the suction's cups. Horizontal loader seemed to happen because the second infeed lanes were to tight not allowing the bottles to reach the loading zone. Als0 seen that the top rail on the flights seemed to tight had maintenance increase the top rail.

05/29/2025 12:00:00 AM,"Experienced large amounts of downtime due to various issues.  At start of shift, glue shots were improperly placed on cartons. This resulted in a bowing effect on the sides of the cartons that although slight, when the weight of other cartons were placed on top during palletization, it would exacerbate the issue which raised the concern on how it would effect running through TP1 during touch 2. Glue shots had to be adjusted several more times over the night by both Randal and Burak, due to fluctuations in carton quality.  Carton quality was the largest cause of downtime today. Having confirmed that the 48x48 pallets are the only pallets we should be grabbing, we found today that not all of those pallets contain good quality cartons. Cartons were noticeably stiffer and slightly more glossy, but Randall began making adjustments to reign in the deviation of the major flap alignment in between fighting the known issues on TD1. As soon as adjusments were made, deviations would fluctuate back the other way and required further adjustments. Eventually adjustments began having zero effect on major flap alignment. Confirmed use of 48x48 pallets of cartons, but determined the quality of them also varies. Isolated the pallet from the line, and some immediate improvement in quality after undoing the adjustments. To better quantify, I took measurements of bad cartons and sent them to Jeff Nguyen to help coordinate with PSC in correcting the issue in variance.  Final few issues were easily corrected. Glue shots went out of spec once again giving us excess glue outside of the major and minor flaps, or more bowing. As well, noticing that after continuous use, the horizontal loader getting stuck behind a folding sensor. This caused minor damage to the plastic on the sensor and the horizontal loading arm, but if caught quickly it can be prevented if happening again. Tightened the allen screw and it immediately resolved how loose the horizontal loader arm had become and prevented the pieces colliding.",TD2

The largest problem we were having was the tetras were so bloated they were getting caught in the gate before the horizontal loader arm, preventing lane one from feeding entirely. Per maintenance teams request (Tom, Ray, & Garrett), cleared a batch/lot change, but ultimately had to clear their flavor change request with Julie and Ryan. Saw an improvement in performance immediately.

Continuously coaching line lead on all aspects of line performance and driving their team. Key area to focus on is line resets.  Measurement taken for all lot codes of Beatbox on TD1 & TD2, and although we haven't been keeping track of the temperature I did notice a significant decrease in jams on both lines today with it being roughly 18 degrees cooler. There are many other variables including increased labor performance, but I believe it's worth measuring to determine if the liquids inside the tetras are prone to expansion in the increased heat.

I was struggling with cartons not opening, multiple cartons coming off the magazine, and can jams for the first hour of the night, but I made a few adjustments to the strongback, the air, and the top guide and I ran much better the rest of the night. Ron also showed me that the vibration over time tightens up the guides the cartons sit down in, and once they're too tight the cartons pop back up again.

We had the normal issues with trailing flaps, cartons not opening, and multiple cartons coming off the magazine causing jams. Was able to adjust to it more quickly though.  It's almost like the machine needs to be adjusted every so often because it shakes itself out of adjustment. You need to be constantly watching to see if something gets moved. The top rails vibrate loose and drop down, the guides the cartons sit down in slowly get closer over time, the strongback slowly opens up over time.

This issue was primarily caused by associates keeping up with the machine and continuously filling the belt, which led to M101 jams due to insufficient spacing. To mitigate this, Maintenance increased the CPM by 1 to create more space and reduce the likelihood of jams. Additionally, a faulty sensor was repeatedly triggering the outlet accumulation sensor, even though the palletizer was not actually backed up. This false signal contributed to M101 jams and significantly increased reset times. Frequent jams were also occurring at the pneumatic separator due to back pressure.",RS1

07/09/2025 12:00:00 AM,"117% of completion Exceeded goal!! 87% up time  37 minutes Broken parts repair: The power twist belt on the air compressor burned out and broke. Maintenance installed a backup belt they had on hand to get the system running again.  10 minutes film wrap quality: Operators were threading the film wrap and likely misaligned the sensor, causing the wrap to be off. Maintenance came and corrected the issue.  37 film change: We performed 4film change. on one of them, the film ran out completely, and the team leads had to re-tread the whole thing. It took a bit longer than usual since they are still new to the process. They both practiced on it at EOS again to get themself familiar with it.",IA1

07/09/2025 12:00:00 AM,3rd Shift EOS   Temple Manual ran moderalty well for the crew we had on it tonight. We had a newer crew and a brand new forklift driver on there for the shift. We around 145 we did change our first film roll and at 530 am our second.  They did stop the line for date changes which I will let them know going forward we will just short date it so we can keep the line going.   The new forklift driver was very good at the driving aspect but is having to take his time with the rfgun. I think by the end of the week he will be proficient.,TA1
07/09/2025 12:00:00 AM,"At the start of the shift, maintenance incorrectly threaded the film, requiring it to be rethreaded a second time. The date coder was also not printing or updating files as expected. Maintenance performed a hard reset, which did not resolve the issue. The problem was ultimately fixed by removing the printer head and manually triggering the fault.  Once the date coder was operational, we experienced further issues with the film wandering off-track and failing to meet quality standards. This was due to the maintenance putting tape on the rollers, which caused inconsistent film wraps. Total downtime for these issues was approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Additionally, we encountered problems with the scores on the Alani 12-pack trays, which were very light or nonexistent. To address this, we assigned one associate to pre-fold trays. The top tier palletizer consistently jammed, forcing us to abandon multiple pallets and switch to manual palletizing after maintenance found a faulty sensor had no spare in the shop.   Two new associates, who were unfamiliar with the Alani 12-pack pattern, required training during the shift. They frequently fell behind, causing line stoppages, and at times forgot the pattern, which led to re-stacking work.  Due to ongoing issues with both the tray former and the top tier palletizer, we moved three associates over to TP1. All associates, except the line lead, were new to TP1 and required additional training time. We only had one forklift driver available to support both TA1 and TP1 for the duration of the shift. I had to jump on a forklift for the rest of the night to help support driver.",TA1
